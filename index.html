    <h1>Privacy Policy for Just Radio</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: 04.06.2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Just Radio ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our mobile application, Just Radio (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Do NOT Collect Directly</h2>
    <p>Just Radio is designed with your privacy in mind. We explicitly state that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect any personal data that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical address).</li>
        <li>We do not require user accounts or registrations.</li>
        <li>We do not collect any sensitive personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information Collected by Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>While Just Radio itself does not directly collect your personal data, certain third-party services integrated into the App may collect information. This includes:</p>

    <h3>2.1. Google Play Store (for In-App Purchases/Subscriptions)</h3>
    <p>When you purchase a Premium subscription through the App, the transaction is processed securely by the Google Play Store. Google collects and processes information related to your purchase, such as transaction details, payment method, and billing information. This data is handled according to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. We do not receive or store your direct payment information.</p>

    <h3>2.2. Analytics (Optional and Anonymous)</h3>
    <p>We may use third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase) to understand how the App is used. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized, focusing on non-personal information such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>App usage (e.g., features used, duration of sessions).</li>
        <li>Device information (e.g., device model, operating system version).</li>
        <li>Geographical region (generalized, not precise location).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This helps us improve the App's performance, stability, and features. You typically have options to opt-out of analytics data collection via your device settings.</p>

    <h3>2.3. Radio Stream Providers</h3>
    <p>When you listen to a radio station, the radio stream is provided by third-party broadcasters. These broadcasters may collect anonymized data about listeners (e.g., number of listeners, general location). This is governed by their respective privacy policies. Please note that some radio stations may include their own embedded advertisements directly within their broadcasts, even in the Premium version of Just Radio, as these are part of the stream itself and not inserted by our App.</p>

    <h3>2.4. AdMob (Google Ads)</h3>
    <p>Our App uses AdMob, an advertising service provided by Google LLC. AdMob collects information about your device and your use of the App to serve personalized advertisements. This data may include, but is not limited to, your device's advertising ID, IP address, device type, operating system, and App usage data. AdMob may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect this information. This data is collected and processed according to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. For more information on how Google uses data, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>. You can opt-out of personalized advertising by visiting your device's settings (Google Settings > Ads) or by using tools provided by industry groups like the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).</p>

    <h3>2.5. Radio-browser.info API</h3>
    <p>Just Radio uses the open-source API provided by radio-browser.info to fetch and display a comprehensive and up-to-date database of global radio stations. When you use the search and discovery features within the App, your query is sent to the radio-browser.info service. The service processes these requests to provide a list of relevant stations. No personal information is sent to or stored by the radio-browser.info API. The data transmitted consists solely of the search queries and related parameters (e.g., country code, tags) necessary to provide the service. This is a crucial component of the App's core functionality.</p>

    <h2>3. How Information is Used (by Third Parties)</h2>
    <p>Any information collected by third-party services is used for purposes such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Processing and fulfilling your in-app purchases (Google Play).</li>
        <li>Understanding App usage to make improvements and fix bugs (Analytics).</li>
        <li>Delivering radio content and measuring audience (Radio Stream Providers).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>While Just Radio does not directly store your personal data, we strive to ensure the security of the App and any data processed by integrated third-party services. We use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Just Radio is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take necessary actions.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
